            <h2><strong>Battlefield Martial Arts</strong></h2>
            <p>
              In Ancient times, Martial Arts were developed for the purpose war,
              not entertainment or sport competition. Society forgets this
              because modern warfare, for the most part, is “fought” from a
              distance with heavy reliance on sophisticated technology and
              weapons. As a result, hand to hand close combat is not a
              developmental priority within modern militaries.<br
                class="displayed"
              /><br class="displayed" />

              Sin’u-Ra is NOT a sport or a self defense system. Sin’u-Ra is a
              BATTLEFIELD MARTIAL ART. Today, individuals competing in “combat
              sports” and self defense practitioners are referred to as “martial
              artists” by the misinformed public. The concept of a Martial
              Artist has been diluted, destroyed, and replaced. Sin’u-Ra
              represents a return to the original purpose of Martial Arts.
              <br class="displayed" /><br class="displayed" />

              Hand to hand close combat is the purest form of war. A Sin’u-Ra
              Specialist is an individual who has mastered the purest form of
              war so that evil does not win. Becoming a Warrior and a
              Battlefield Martial Artist requires the body of an individual to
              become a weapon for the purpose of defeating evil in the rawest
              form of the modern battlefield.<br class="displayed" /><br
                class="displayed"
              />

              Martial is defined as, relating to or specific FOR WAR. Martial is
              NOT defined as, relating to or specific for SPORT. In ancient
              times, a Battlefield Martial Artist would be required to turn his
              body into a weapon to defeat evil. In ancient warrior societies,
              this was considered the highest honor. Unfortunately, this is
              completely absent from today’s society.
              <br class="displayed" /><br class="displayed" />

              “Combat sport” practitioners are athletes and entertainers who
              prepare to compete in a specific sport competition with rules and
              referees. These competitions are in a specific discipline against
              one opponent in a controlled environment.<br
                class="displayed"
              /><br class="displayed" />

              These sport competitions have a specific time duration for the
              purpose of entertainment and financial reward. To add to this,
              there are obviously no multiple enemy or armed enemy situations.
              All “combat sport tactics and techniques” are based on these
              realities. Therefore combat sports have no relevance within the
              rawest form of the modern battlefield. <br class="displayed" /><br
                class="displayed"
              />

              In addition, self defense practitioners are representatives of a
              community that combine combat sports with inadequate weapon disarm
              tactics and releases. The combination of combat sports, inadequate
              disarm tactics, and defensive reactions represent an excellent
              formula if the objective is to get badly hurt or killed in a hand
              to hand close combat situation against evil.<br
                class="displayed"
              /><br class="displayed" />

              The purest form of war is hand to hand close combat against evil.
              The path to becoming a true Battlefield Martial Artist requires
              the individual’s body to become a weapon for the purpose of
              defeating evil in the rawest form of the modern battlefield. For
              this to become a reality, specific components must be perfected.
              Through specific suffering and sacrifice, Sin’u-Ra is earned.<br
