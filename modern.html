            <h2><strong>Rawest Form of Modern Battlefield</strong></h2>
            <p>
              Hand to hand close combat is not a developmental priority within
              the Military. As a result, soldiers are not prepared to defeat
              evil in the RAWEST FORM OF THE MODERN BATTLEFIELD.<br
                class="displayed"
              /><br class="displayed" />

              Sophisticated modern weapons and technology have ruined the purity
              of warfare. Although modern warfare is synonymous with
              sophisticated weapons and technology, the possibility of having to
              survive THE RAWEST FORM OF THE BATTLEFIELD remains a reality.<br
                class="displayed"
              /><br class="displayed" />

              The rawest form of the modern battlefield is when weapons and
              technology are not an option. This is what Sin’u-Ra was created
              for.<br class="displayed" /><br class="displayed" />

              Muscular strength, power, and muscular endurance are essential to
              perfecting the purest form of war and dominating the rawest form
              of the modern battlefield.

                  <strong>Muscular Strength:</strong> Ability to exert a maximal
                  force at a single point.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Power:</strong> Ability to exert a maximal force in as
                  short a time as possible.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Muscular Endurance:</strong> Ability to repeatedly
                  exert a less than maximum force over a given time.

              The rawest form of the modern battlefield requires Sin’u-Ra
              tactical, technical, principle (TTP) components to be perfected.
              In addition to muscular strength, power, and muscular endurance,
              Sin’u-Ra TTP components require fluid transitions between specific
              traits of the musculoskeletal system.

            <p>
              A Warrior needs to understand his environment. As we witness
              today, the world is in chaos. Evil is everywhere and influencing
              everything. The rawest form of the modern battlefield is no longer
              just a military concept.<br class="displayed" /><br
                class="displayed"
              />

              Economic concerns and distrust of leadership seem to be consistent
              issues throughout time. However, in addition to these issues, the
              21st century has unique problems. Technology has become a platform
              for false information and dangerous “influencers.” Social media
              and social agendas have negatively programmed society. As a
              result, the chaos we witness today has become violent.<br
                class="displayed"
              /><br class="displayed" />

              America is experiencing a “cold” civil war, while also enduring a
              serious drug problem. There are mass shootings everyday, and
              “routine” confrontations and arguments regularly escalate into
              deadly encounters. Nations have always had external enemies.
              Today, however, nations are divided and the greatest threats come
              from within. Trust and respect amongst people has disappeared.
              <br class="displayed" /><br class="displayed" />

              These circumstances are usually amplified by corrupt leadership
              who view instability as an opportunity to consolidate power. These
              21st century realities have inspired a specific martial arts
              philosophy.<br class="displayed" /><br class="displayed" />

              Hand to hand close combat is the purest form of war. Sin’u-Ra is a
              Battlefield Martial Art and the perfection of the purest form of
              war. To be successful in the rawest form of the modern
              battlefield, an individual must become Sin’u-Ra.<br
                class="displayed"
              /><br class="displayed" />

              Today, going to buy groceries has the potential to be just as
              dangerous as operating a military check point. Both environments
              represent the potential for a shooting, stabbing, or multiple
              enemy attack. The civilian population is in denial of this
              reality.<br class="displayed" /><br class="displayed" />

              Sin’u-Ra, the perfection of purest form of war, was created for
              the battlefield. One can make the argument that Sin’u-Ra is
              equally needed within the civilian population. All over the world,
              but especially in America, civilians face the realities of
              unstable and divided nations. Violent attacks, such as shootings
              and stabbings, occur on a daily basis. To add to this, criminal
              activity and extreme ideologies have become mainstream.<br
                class="displayed"
              /><br class="displayed" />

              Evil needs to fear you. The line between military and civilian
              environments have become blurred. If the objective is to create a
              Warrior and dominate the rawest form of the modern battlefield, an
              individual’s physical development, training, and testing should be
              centered around perfecting the purest form of war and becoming a
              Battlefield Martial Artist. Those that choose to accept the
              Sin’u-Ra path will have an advantage over those that don’t.
