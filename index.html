            <p>
              Hand to hand close combat is the purest form of war. Sin’u-Ra is the perfection of the purest form of war and the defining characteristic of a Warrior. A Sin’u-Ra Specialist defines what it means to be a Battlefield Martial Artist.

                <li>The simultaneous development, training, and testing of specific tactical, technical, principle (TTP) and strength, power, endurance (SPE) components. </li>
                <li>Hand to hand close combat tactical precision that requires a balance between aggression and composure.</li>

            <h2><strong>What Sin'u-Ra is NOT</strong></h2>
            <p>
              This is not a sport or a self defense system. Incorrect
              interpretations of hand to hand close combat create false
              expectations, and negatively interfere with strength and power
              development. There are serious risks and unfortunate outcomes that
              occur when incorrect interpretations of hand to hand close combat
              are introduced to individuals.

              <h3><strong>The Sin'u-Ra Path</strong></h3>
              <p>
                What does it mean to be Sin’u-Ra? It means devoting yourself to
                a mission and a set of principles that require the perfection of
                hand to hand close combat and its components to become the
                nucleus of what you are so that evil does not win. Perfecting
                the purest form of war is a way of life. Specific suffering and
                sacrifice turns the body into a weapon. This is the SIN’U-RA
                PATH. You don’t learn Sin’u-Ra. You become Sin’u-Ra.

                <strong>The Sin'u-Ra Philosphy </strong><br><em>So evil does not win</em>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  After the initial contact against the enemy, he must be
                  controlled. Efficient forward progression must immediately
                  follow the initial contact.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The enemy must be attacked where he is unprepared to defend.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Sin’u-Ra is not a combination of various “martial arts.” Each
                  component within Sin’u-Ra is specific to dominating the rawest
                  form of the battlefield.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The body must become a weapon, and the enemy must fear you.
                  Under no circumstances will evil win.

						<h2><em><strong>"The Program"</strong></em></h2>
						<div class="program">
              <h4><strong>Training is Testing</strong></h4>
							<ul class="outerList">
							  <li>Step 1: Application and Interview</li>
							  <li>Step 2: Physical Abilities Test</li>
							  <li>Step 3: Admission to "The Program"</li>

						<p>The SPECIFIC suffering and sacrifice within The Program will determine if the individual has the ability to be Sin’u-Ra.  Few have the physical or mental capacity to endure the Sin’u-Ra Program.  Far less have the ability to live the Sin’u-Ra Path. Hand to hand close combat is the purest form of war.  Sin’u-Ra is the perfection of the purest form of war, and the defining characteristic of a Warrior. This is not a sport or a self defense system.  Do not approach Sin’u-Ra with that kind of mindset.  A background in any of those incorrect interpretations of hand to hand close combat will not serve you well in Sin’u-Ra. Consistent perfection is the standard.  Every training session is a test.  The Program is only for specific individuals.  Those who are admitted will develop, train, and test Sin’u-Ra TTP and SPE components.  </p>
						<p>Those who graduate will become world class Battlefield Martial Artists. From this point, the training really begins. The pace of training will be set by the Chief Specialist.  Turning the body into a weapon and perfecting the purest form of war requires specific suffering and sacrifice.  The specific suffering and sacrifice never ends. Validity and respect based on past “accomplishments” are not accepted within Sin’u-Ra.  Who you think you are or what you think you may have done in life is irrelevant.  You will earn respect each day or you won’t.  As mentioned, every training session is a test.  Sin’u-Ra is a privilege and a responsibility that must be earned every day.</p>
