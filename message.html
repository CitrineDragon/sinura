            <h2><strong>Gabriel's Message</strong></h2>
            <p>
              My name is Gabriel, the Sin’u-Ra Chief Specialist.  I am a certified Tactical Strength and Conditioning Facilitator (TSAC-F), and a hand to hand close combat expert.  For me, physical training has always been deeper than just physical development.<br class="displayed"><br class="displayed">

              The purpose of physical training is to challenge the soul so that clarity of purpose can be earned.  As a result, the body and mind begin to operate at higher levels.  This led me to finishing a Military Special Operations Selection in an allied military (IDF) as the top ranked individual for physical performance, and an invite to participate in an NFL try-out camp without having any prior experience.<br class="displayed"><br class="displayed">

              These past experiences are irrelevant.  What led me to become a Battlefield Martial Artist and the Chief Sin’u-Ra Specialist was specific suffering and sacrifice.  All you need to know about me is I created Sin’u-Ra, the perfection of the purest form of war and it’s components.  I earn this everyday. <br class="displayed"><br class="displayed"> 

              Specific suffering and sacrifice in the shadows, when no one was around, led me to perfecting the purest form of war.  Sin’u-Ra is a way of life.  This is my purpose.  Few are willing to sacrifice to achieve something.  Far less are willing to consistently suffer and sacrifice for no financial incentive, attention, social acceptance, or power consolidation.<br class="displayed"><br class="displayed">

              Hand to hand close combat is not a sport.  It is the purest form of war, and the defining characteristic of a Warrior.  This will be repeated constantly.  It also represents the culture of the rawest form of the modern battlefield.  An individual is not a Warrior if he is unable to attack and control the enemy, without of a weapon, regardless of who initiated combat or how combat was initiated.<br class="displayed"><br class="displayed">

              My physical training is centered around turning the body into a weapon so evil does not win.  I have established a very clear training objective and way of measuring performance.<br class="displayed"><br class="displayed"> 

              To become a Warrior and a Battlefield Martial Artist, it is imperative to master Sin’u-Ra tactical, technical, principle (TTP) and strength, power, endurance (SPE) components.  These specific TTP and SPE components are then simultaneously developed, trained, and tested.<br class="displayed"><br class="displayed">

              If an individual is Sin’u-Ra, it’s best you respect that.  Welcome to my world! <br class="displayed"><br class="displayed">
